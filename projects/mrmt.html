                <h2>Modular Rack Mount Things (MRMT)</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The MRMT project is a general-purpose framework designed to provide a flexible, high-speed, and easy to design for platform with a focus on modularity and affordability. I have some upcoming SDR projects that have a need for high speed communication, and after roughing out some ideas for that, I thought it would be cool to build out the system into its own standard that I can use for any upcoming projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the backplane we drew inspiration from the military OpenVPX standard with high speed board to board communication for latency-sensitive and high bandwidth applications, along with 100BASE-T ethernet feeding into a router board for slower speed board to board communication along with data input and output.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The MRMT system features a standard PCB size of 95mm x 100mm with DIN41612 connectors for robust module-to-backplane communication, there are two backplane connectors, one for the high speed surface (HSS) which includes the high speed board to board communication along with the 100BASE-T ethernet, and another connector called the utility surface (US) providing power at 5 and 12 volts, and one low speed communication surface. This is done so that low speed devices do not need to spend money on a large DIN41612 connector to communicate on the HSS</p>
